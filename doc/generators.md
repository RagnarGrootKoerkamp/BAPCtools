# Generators

Generators are provided in the `generators/` directory and may be used to
generate test cases. If it is present, the file `generators/generators.yaml`
specifies which testcases should be generated and which commands should be run
to generate them. See [generators.yaml](generators.yaml) for a full example
configuration with comments explaining all the valid keys.

When `generators/generators.yaml` is present, _all_ test cases in
`data/{sample,secret,...}` must be generated by it. It is not allowed to generate
some testcases and some not.

See [`./generators.yaml`](./generators.yaml) for an exhaustive example file with explanations.

A Json schema can be found [here](../support/generators_yaml_schema.json), which
can be used together with most YAML LSP's to provide autocompletion and
validation when editing `generator.yaml` files.

A [CUE](https://cuelang.org/docs/references/spec/) specification can be found [here](../support/generators_yaml_schema.cue).
A `generators.yaml` file can be validated against this spec using the `cue`
command line tool.

## Specification

The two main object types are `directory` and `generator`. The root of `generators.yaml` is a `directory` which corresponds to the `data/` directory.

**Directory objects** take the following keys:

- `testdata.yaml`: Optional yaml configuration that will be copied to `testdata.yaml` in this directory.
- `solution`: Optional invocation of a solution to be used to generate `.ans` files. Set to empty to disable generating `.ans`. (Useful for e.g. the `data/samples/` directory.) This must be an absolute path relative to the problem root.
- `visualizer`: Optional invocation of a visualizer to generate visualizations for each test case in this directory.
  This must be an absolute path relative to the problem root. Set to empty to disable.
- `random_salt`: Optional string that will be prepended to each command before computing its `{seed}`. May be used to regenerate all random cases and to prevent predictable seeds.
- `data`: The test cases / test groups contained in this directory. This may take two forms:
  - A dictionary, each key is the name of a test case/test group, and each value must be a `directory` or `generator` object.
  - A list of dictionaries as above. In this case, testcases will be prefixed with zero padded 1-based integers in the order of the list. Items in the same dictionary will get the same number.
- `input`: Optional list of Directory object names (as strings) e.g. `- "sample"`. All testcases from those directories are linked for this directory.

**Generator objects** have the following forms:
- `generate: <generator_name> <arguments>`. `<generator_name>` must either be a program (file/directory) in `generators/` or else a name in the top level `generators` dictionary (see below). Arguments may contain `{name}` to refer to the name of the testcase and `{seed}` or `{seed:(0-9)+}` to add a random seed. Arguments are separated by white space (space, tab, newline). Quoting white space is not supported.
  - `count: <int>`. To invoke the `generate` with multiple seeds to generate multiple testcase of the same kind. This is only valid if `{seed}` or `{seed:(0-9)+}` is present in the arguments of `generate`.
- `copy: <base_path>`: For all known extensions `<ext>` the corresponding file `<base_path>.<ext>` will be copied to the specified location should it be present. `<base_path>` must be relative to `generators/`.
- `<ext>: <content>`: A file with extension `ext` and the `content` will be generated. `<ext>` must be a known file extension.
Or as a shorthand:
- `command` followed by the command as for `generate`.

The follwoing things should hold:
- A `.in` file must be specified/generated by this
- If a `.ans` file is not specified/generated a `solution` must be provided that will be used to generate the `.ans`. For interactive Problems

**Root object**
The root of the `generators.yaml` is a `directory` object with one optional additional key:

- `generators`: a dictionary mapping generator names to a list of dependencies.
  This must be used when using non-directory generators that depend on other files in the `generators/` directory. Each key of the dictionary is the name of a generator, and values must be lists of file paths relative to `generators/`.

  When this dictionary contains a name that's also a file in `generators/`, the version specified in the `generators` dictionary will have priority.

  Generators specified in the `generators` dictionary are built by coping the list of files into a new directory, and then building the resulting program as usual. The first dependency listed will be used to determine the entry point.

  Other generators are built as (file or directory) [programs](./Problem_Format#Programs).
