# Generators

Generators are provided in the `generators/` directory and may be used to
generate test cases.  If it is present, the file `generators/generators.yaml`
specifies which testcases should be generated and which commands should be run
to generate them. See [generators.yaml](generators.yaml) for an full example
configuration with comments explaining all the valid keys.

When `generators/generators.yaml` is present, _all_ test cases in
`data/{sample,secret}` must be mentioned by it. It is not allowed to generate
some testcases while not mentioning others. Testcases must be explicitly
listed as manually created to prevent this issue.

Below are an explanation of the specification and a formal [CUE specification](#cue-specification).

## Specification

The two main object types are `directory` and `generator`. The root of `generators.yaml` is a `directory` which corresponds to the `data/` directory.

**Directory objects** take the following keys:
* `type`: This must be set to `directory`.
* `testdata.yaml`: Optional yaml configuration that will be copied to `testdata.yaml` in this directory.
* `solution`: Optional invocation of a solution to be used to generate `.ans` files. Set to empty to disable generating `.ans`. (Useful for e.g. the `data/samples/` directory.)
    * Relative paths are relative to `generators/`.
    * Absolute paths are relative to the problem root.
* `visualizer`: Optional invocation of a visualizer to generate visualizations for each test case in this directory.
    * Relative paths are relative to `generators/`.
    * Absolute paths are relative to the problem root.
* `random_salt`: Optional string that will be prepended to each command before computing its `{seed}`. May be used to regenerate all random cases and to prevent predictable seeds.
* `data`: The test cases / test groups contained in this directory. This may take two forms:
    * A dictionary, each key is the name of a test case/test group, and each value must be a `directory` or `generator` object.
    * A list of dictionaries as above. In this case, testcases will automatically be prefixed with numbers in the order of the list.
* `generators`: The root directory may contain a dictionary listing generators and their dependencies. This may be used when using non-directory programs as generators which depend on other files in the `generators/` directory. Each key of the dictionary is the name of a generator, and values must be lists of file paths relative to `generators/`.

**Generator objects** have one of the following forms:
- `null`: An empty generator means that the testcase is a manual case and must not be modified or deleted by generator tooling.
- `command`: A command can take two forms:
    - A path to a `.in` file which must be relative to `generators/`. The `.in` file and corresponding files with known extensions will be copied to the specified location.
    - An invocation of a generator: `<generator_name> <arguments>`. `<generator_name>` must either be a program (file/directory) in `generators/` or else a name in the top level `generators` dictionary (see below). Arguments may contain `{name}` to refer to the name of the testcase and `{seed}` or `{seed:(0-9)+}` to add a random seed.
- A dictionary containing `type: testcase`. In this case, `input` is a `command` as above, and the dictionary may furthermore contain the `solution`, `visualizer`, and `random_salt` keys to specialize them for this testcase only.


## CUE specification.

Below is a formal CUE specification for the `generators.yaml` file with a root object `Generators`. Note that the `...` in `generator` and `directory` indicate that additional keys unknown to the spec are allowed. The `generator_reserved` and `directory_reserved` objects indicate keys that work only for `generator`/`directory` and should not be reused in other places.

```
command :: !="" & (=~"^[^{}]*(\\{(name|seed(:[0-9]+)?)\\}[^{}]*)*$")
file_config :: {
    solution?: command | null
    visualizer?: command | null
    random_salt?: string
}
generator :: command | {
    type: "testcase"
    input: command
    file_config
    directory_reserved
    ...
}
data_dict :: {
    [string]: directory | generator | null
}
directory :: {
    type: "directory"
    file_config
    "testdata.yaml"?: {
        ...
    }
    data?: data_dict | [...data_dict]
    generator_reserved
    ...
}
Generators :: {
    generators?: {
        [string]: [...string]
    }
    directory
}

generator_reserved :: {
    input?: _|_
    ...
}
directory_reserved :: {
    data?: _|_
    include?: _|_
    "testdata.yaml"?: _|_
    ...
}
```
