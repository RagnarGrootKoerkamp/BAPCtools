    \begin{block}{Problem}
        This is a multi-pass problem, where in each pass, you should:
        \vspace{-0.5em}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Encrypt text, such that the length stays the same and every character differs.
            \item Decrypt the text that you encrypted, such that you retrieve the original input.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{block}
    \pause
    \begin{block}{Solution}
        Some of the many possible solutions (there were some resubmissions):
        \begin{itemize}
            \addtolength{\leftmargini}{15ex}
            \small
            \item ($70\times$) Use a Caesar cipher with offset $1 \leq x < 26$ for encrypting, and offset $26 - x$ for decrypting.
            \item ($14\times$) Use a Caesar cipher with offset $13$ for both encrypting and decrypting.
            \item ($2\times$) Assuming $0$-based \texttt{char} values, XOR the last bit of each value
                (`\texttt{a}' $\leftrightarrow$ `\texttt{b}',
                `\texttt{c}' $\leftrightarrow$ `\texttt{d}', \dots).
            \item ($1\times$) Atbash: Mirror the characters (`\texttt{a}' $\leftrightarrow$ `\texttt{z}',
            `\texttt{b}' $\leftrightarrow$ `\texttt{y}', \dots)
            for both encrypting and decrypting.
            \item ($1\times$) Generate a (seeded) random permutation to encrypt, and use its inverse to decrypt.
        \end{itemize}
