\problemname{A Different Problem}

Write a program that computes the difference between non-negative integers.

\section*{Input}

The input consists of multiple test cases (at least $1$ and at most
$40$), one per line.  Each test case consists of a pair of integers,
between $0$ and $10^{15}$ (inclusive).  The input is terminated by
end of file.

\section*{Output}

For each pair of integers in the input, output one line, containing the absolute value of their difference.
