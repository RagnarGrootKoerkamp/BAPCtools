Given the area $a$ of a square, calculate its perimeter.

\section*{Input}

The input consists of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item One line with an integer $a$ ($0\leq a\leq \maxa$), the area of the square.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Output}

Output the perimeter of the square with area $a$.
Your answer should have an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-6}$.
