# Problem:

Print the perimeter of a square with a given area $a$.

NOTE: Please put possible variants of the problem in the problem statement
itself.

## Solution and analysis:

A square with area $a$ has a side length of $\sqrt a$. A square has 4 sides so
the total perimeter is $4\sqrt a$.

One potential issue is that teams might not print sufficiently many digits.


## Difficulty:
(0%: everybody solves the problem, 99%: 1 team solves the problem)
5%: I think that 5% of BAPC teams will *not* solve this.
