# Difficulty:
(0%: everybody solves the problem, 99%: 1 team solves the problem)
5%: I think that 5% of NWERC teams will *not* solve this.

# Solution and analysis:

A square with area $a$ has a side length of $\sqrt a$. A square has 4 sides so
the total perimeter is $4\sqrt a$.

One potential issue is that teams might not print sufficiently many digits.
